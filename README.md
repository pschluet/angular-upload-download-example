# angular-upload-download-example

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

## Functionality

This is a simple form that allows the user to select any file and upload it to the server. The server prints the contents of the request body (including uploaded file contents) to the console, then returns the `sample.xlsx` Excel file to the front-end. The front-end then saves the file to the user's computer.

## Front-End

Run `npm start` to launch the front-end. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Back-End

Run `node server.js` to start the back-end server.
